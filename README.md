# AI-Dungeon-2-Scrubbed-Edition-Redux
State of the art AI plays dungeon master to your adventures. Now with less things that could embarrass you in front of your supervisor. Original version created by CloverAnon on Github.

Go to the Releases section to get the scrubbed version. Identical to the original, but all the obscene stuff has been removed from the prompts / code. I still have to remove the auto-downloading of prompts if the directory is empty, among other things.
